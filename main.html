    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. A lower time complexity generally means the algorithm is more efficient.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. A commonly used notation for expressing this is O(n).</p>
